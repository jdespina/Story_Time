On a bright Thursday morning, Team Tesla was jamming out to Du Hast by German metal band Rammstein on the way to the flughafen
to pick up Professor Mehlhase from her trip overseas in Munich.

As they were driving their BMW down Hauptstrasse the car began to make clanking noises and black smoke began to pour out from
beneath the hood.

As they were looking under the hood they understood what was wrong, the Klimaanlage under the hood had dismantled and was the cause of the clanging. 

Since they did not have any tools on them, they were hoping the near by Ratskeller had some tools.

Unable to find any tools at the Ratskeller, they tried asking the Biergarten next door if they had tools.

After scouring the biergarten to no avail, Team Tesla was at a loss. Hoping to recieve some counseling, they walked back down 
Hauptstrasse looking for possible solutions when, out of nowhere, a sourdough brot hit Alex Matsukawa in the head at 15 km/hr, 
knocking him out cold.
