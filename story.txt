On a bright Thursday morning, Team Tesla was jamming out to Du Hast by German metal band Rammstein on the way to the flughafen
to pick up Professor Mehlhase from her trip overseas in Munich.

As they were driving their BMW down Hauptstrasse the car began to make clanking noises and black smoke began to pour out from
beneath the hood.

As they were looking under the hood they understood what was wrong, the Klimaanlage under the hood had dismantled and was the cause of the clanging. 

Since they did not have any tools on them, they were hoping the near by Ratskeller had some tools.

Unable to find any tools at the Ratskeller, they tried asking the Biergarten next door if they had tools.

After scouring the biergarten to no avail, Team Tesla was at a loss. Hoping to recieve some counseling, they walked back down 
Hauptstrasse looking for possible solutions when, out of nowhere, a sourdough brot hit Alex Matsukawa in the head at 15 km/hr, 
knocking him out cold.

When he woke up, he was on a bench in the middle of downtown Munich with no recolection at all.

Alex suddenly rememembered that he was actually part of Team VW, not Team Tesla. He began looking around taking in his 
surroundings, and found himself face-to-face with Jeff Buck, who handed him a Bratwurst.

Confused and dazed, he stared at the Bratwurst. After a long silence he pulled up his lederhose and grabbed the Bratwurst then threw it at his face.
